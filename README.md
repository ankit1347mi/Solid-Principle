The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that aim to make software systems more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym represents the following principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility or job. This principle encourages a class to be focused on doing one thing well.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This implies that you can add new functionality without altering existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. In other words, objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program's functionality.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle suggests that it is better to have multiple small, specific interfaces rather than a large, monolithic one, and classes should only be required to implement the interfaces that are relevant to them.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define a level of indirection between high-level and low-level modules, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.
By adhering to these SOLID principles, developers can create software that is modular, adaptable, and less prone to bugs. These principles are considered good practices in object-oriented design and contribute to the creation of robust and maintainable code.
